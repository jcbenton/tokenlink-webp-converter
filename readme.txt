== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin rewrite image URLs or modify post content? =
No. It only generates and registers `.webp` images. Your posts, pages, and HTML remain untouched.

= Where are the WebP images stored? =
In the same directory as the original image (e.g., `/uploads/2025/10/image.webp`).

= Can I safely delete the original files? =
Yes. The **Delete Original** button is available only when a valid `.webp` version exists. It requires double-click confirmation.

= Do I need Imagick installed? =
No. The plugin automatically falls back to the GD library if Imagick is unavailable.

= Will this affect new uploads? =
No. TokenLink WebP Converter only acts on existing media items that you manually convert.
