## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this plugin rewrite image URLs or modify post content?
No. It only generates and registers `.webp` images. Your posts, pages, and HTML remain untouched.

### Where are the WebP images stored?
In the same directory as the original image, e.g. `/uploads/2025/10/image.webp`.

### Can I safely delete the original files?
Yes. The **Delete Original** button is only available when a valid `.webp` version exists. It requires double-click confirmation before deletion.

### Do I need Imagick installed?
No. The plugin automatically falls back to the GD library if Imagick is not available.

### Will this affect new uploads?
No. TokenLink WebP Converter only acts on existing media items that you manually convert.
